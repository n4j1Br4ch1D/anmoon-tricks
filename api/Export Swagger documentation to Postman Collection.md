## How to export Swagger documentation to Postman Collection?

For Me Personally as for many devlopers i know like using Swagger for documentation but postman for testing.
thus this trick helps a lot:

1. Go To swagger documentation endpoint.
      
<img src="/main/api/Export%20Swagger%20documentation%20to%20Postman%20Collection/api-1.png" height="200" width="300"/>

2. Click on the link as highlighted below & Copy the URL. 
   
<img src="/main/api/Export%20Swagger%20documentation%20to%20Postman%20Collection/api-2.png" height="200" width="300"/>

3. Go To  Postman, Click Import at Top-Left corner:

<img src="/main/api/Export%20Swagger%20documentation%20to%20Postman%20Collection/api-3.png" height="200" width="300"/>

4. Switch to Link tab & paste the copied URL:

<img src="/main/api/Export%20Swagger%20documentation%20to%20Postman%20Collection/api-4.png" height="200" width="300"/>

5. Choose default settings & click Import:

<img src="/main/api/Export%20Swagger%20documentation%20to%20Postman%20Collection/api-5.png" height="200" width="300"/>

6. Your new collection will appear with all your endpoints and data:

<img src="/main/api/Export%20Swagger%20documentation%20to%20Postman%20Collection/api-6.png" height="200" width="300"/>


## Problem With Swagger & Postman?

The only problem with this approach, which developers been complining about for years know is there is no sync between both tool, each time you made changes to your API you will have to re-import  which leads to loose your testsm & data.
